* WHAT IS CPM?
* CPM (or counts per minute) is events quantity from Geiger Tube you get during one minute. Usually it used to 
* calculate a radiation level. Different GM Tubes has different quantity of CPM for background. Some tubes can produce
* about 10-50 CPM for normal background, other GM Tube models produce 50-100 CPM or 0-5 CPM for same radiation level.
* Please refer your GM Tube datasheet for more information. Just for reference here, J305 and SBM-20 can generate 
* about 10-50 CPM for normal background. 
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* HOW TO CONNECT GEIGER KIT?
* The kit 3 wires that should be connected to Arduino UNO board: 5V, GND and INT. PullUp resistor is included on
* kit PCB. Connect INT wire to Digital Pin#2 (INT0), 5V to 5V, GND to GND. Then connect the Arduino with
* USB cable to the computer and upload this sketch.
